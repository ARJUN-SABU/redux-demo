<p>Main concept is:</p>
<p>In our app, we'll have 2 features: cake and icecream. So, for every feature, we create a folder inside the feature folder that is, cake folder and icecream folder. Inside cake folder, we'll create a .js file with <b>Slice</b> keyword as a suffix that is, cakeSlice.js for cake feature and icecreamSlice.js for icecream feature. Inside cakeSlice, we'll define the initialState, reducers and actions for cake using the redux-toolkit style of code.</p>
